                <p class="description"> The equipment you might require for this recipe is:</p>
                <h3>1. A Spiralizer</h3>

                    <img src="img/Spiralizer2.jpg" alt="A barebones Spiralizer">
                    <figcaption> Two Spiralizers. The first is a fancy (and expensive) one called the A Paderno World Cuisine Tri-Blade Spiralizer, and the second is a basic run-of-the-mill spiralizer you find a walmart for about 5 dollars </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This one is absolutely essential to the recipe, as you can't make Zoodles without it! Whether you have a super cheap one, or a fancier one that saves your wrist and lets you choose your preferred thickness, either one will get the job done.</p>

                <h3>2. A Non-Stick Pan</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/Non_Stick_Pan.jpg" alt="A non-stick pan">
                    <figcaption> Ya gotta cook with something, why not pick something that won't get your food stuck to it? </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Of course you'll need a pan for this recipe, unless you're thinking of cooking your zoodles in a pot (but please don't). I reccommend a non-stick pan over cast-iron or the like, so you don't burn your zoodles or have them stick to the pan while you're turning them. Non-stick pans provide a more even source of heat, and will save you the scraping hassle.</p>

                <h3>3. A Garlic Press (optional)</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>A garlic press is not an essential item, but it's definitely an appreciated convenience to not have to chop up your garlic into tiny little pieces yourself. The garlic press squeezes out the garlic, making it closer to a pureee consistancy and thus allowing the flavour to mix in the food better.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Ingredients</h2>
                <p class="description"> For this recipe, you'll need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> 1 Zucchini.</li>
                    <li> 2 tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
                    <li> 1/4 cup of cream cheese. </li>
                    <li> A pinch of garlic powder (or 2 cloves of fresh garlic).</li>
                    <li> Parmasean Cheese (any amount you prefer to sprinkle on).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="instructionsContainer">
                <h2 class="subheading">Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the ends of the Zucchini, and spiralize it (choose any thickness you prefer, if you have that option).</li>
                    <li>Preheat olive oil over medium-high heat. </li>
                    <li>Add crushed garlic cloves. Allow garlic to flavour the oil for a minute or so (If you are just using garlic powder instead, skip this step).</li>
                    <li>Add zucchini noodles and garlic powder to the dish, and cook for 3-5 minutes or until lightly softened.</li>
                    <li>Move noodles to one side and add cream cheese, stirring until melted. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Add parmasean cheese to garnish.</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="tipsAndWarningsContainer">
                <h2 class="subheading">Tips and Warnings</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't put in the garlic powder too early! Garlic powder burns much easier than a actual cloves of garlic, and if it burns it will have a bitter taste to it</li>
                    <li>Make sure the zoodles only cook for a very short time, a couple minutes at most. Since zucchini is made up of almost entirely water, if you cook them too long they will get soggy and start to release all their water. Unless you want a Zoodle soup, be mindful of that</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to season it up. This recipe is kept simple for the sake of time and beginner friendliness, but you're free to add more herbs, spices, and even some protein. My go-to is chicken for the protein, and basil and orgeno for some extra herby goodness.</li>
                </ul>
